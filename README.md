## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> No content model prompt provided - app built from existing content structure

### Code Generation Prompt

> Build a webapp that can capture a screenshot from a webpage URL and save to the cosmic bucket media. Make a UI located on the home page with text input and an API endpoint that functions the same to take a URL and upload screenshot.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

## üì° Screenshot Methods

This application uses a dual-method approach for maximum reliability:

### Primary Method: Playwright
- **Modern browser automation** - More reliable than Puppeteer
- **Better performance** - Faster screenshot generation
- **Enhanced stability** - Better handling of complex websites
- **Local processing** - No external API dependencies

### Fallback Method: htmlcsstoimage.com API
- **Cloud-based service** - External API for screenshot generation
- **High reliability** - Professional screenshot service
- **Automatic fallback** - Activates when Playwright fails
- **Requires API key** - Sign up at [htmlcsstoimage.com](https://htmlcsstoimage.com)

## üì° Cosmic SDK Examples

### Screenshot Media Upload

```typescript
import { cosmic } from '@/lib/cosmic'

// Upload screenshot to Cosmic media library

  const formData = new FormData()
  const blob = new Blob([imageBuffer], { type: 'image/png' })
  formData.append('media', blob, filename)
  formData.append('folder', 'screenshots')
  
  const media = await cosmic.media.insertOne(formData)
  return media
}
```

### Retrieve Screenshot Media

```typescript
// Get all screenshots from media library
const getScreenshots = async () => {
  const media = await cosmic.media.find({
    folder: 'screenshots'
  }).props(['id', 'name', 'url', 'imgix_url', 'created_at'])
  
  return media.media
}
```
